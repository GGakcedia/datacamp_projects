'''Project Instructions
    Understand the factors that help a business be timeless by answering these questions:
What is the oldest business on each continent? Save your answer as a DataFrame called oldest_business_continent with four columns: continent, country, business, and year_founded in any order.
How many countries per continent lack data on the oldest businesses? Does including new_businesses change this? Count the number of countries per continent missing business data, including new_businesses, and store the results in a DataFrame named count_missing with columns for the continent and the count.
Which business categories are best suited to last many years, and on what continent are they? Create a DataFrame called oldest_by_continent_category that stores the oldest founding year for each continent and category combination. It should contain three columns: continent, category, and year_founded, in that order.
!!! The code may not work because the datasets are not loaded. This project was taken from DataCamp for practice.

# Start coding here!
# Use as many cells as you like
# What is the oldest business on every continent?

# Start by merging the businesses and countries datasets into one

# Create a new DataFrame that lists only the continent and oldest year_founded

# Does including the `new_businesses` data change this?

# Add the data in new_businesses to the existing businesses

# Perform a new merge between the businesses and the countries data. Use additional parameters this time to perform an outer merge and create an indicator column to better see the missing values. An outer merge combines two DataFrames based on a key column and includes all rows from both DataFrames

# Filter to find countries with missing business data

# Group by continent and create a "count_missing" column
count_missing = new_missing_countries.groupby("continent").agg({"country":"count"})

# View the results

# Which business categories are best suited to last over the course of centuries?

# Start by merging the businesses and categories data into one DataFrame
